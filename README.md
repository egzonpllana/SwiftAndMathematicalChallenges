# Welcome to iOS UI Components challenges
This repository will be showing to you some of the components that I have build during the weeknds to explore new Swift API (for me) so I don't feel bored during the weekend :)

## 1st Challenge: Gauge View
In this challenge, I will demonstrate how to build a gauge view, applying trigonometric functions to calculate positions and angles to build gradient path, labels position and the move logic of the gauge indicator. With this approach I will try to show the bridge between abstract mathematics and practical coding in Swift for iOS.

## 1st Challenge: Book View
In this interesting challenge, we delve into creating a flippable page effect using UIKit, exploring the nuances of achieving a realistic page-turning animation. Our analysis begins with understanding the pivotal role of the anchor point in view rotations, which defaults to the center of the view. This central pivoting can lead to a card-like rotation, rather than the desired page-flipping effect.
