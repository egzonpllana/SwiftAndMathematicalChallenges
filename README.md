# Welcome to iOS UI Components challenges
This repository will be showing to you some of the components that I have build during the weeknds to explore new Swift API (for me) so I don't feel bored during the weekend :)

## 1st Challenge: Gauge View
In this challenge, I will demonstrate how to build a gauge view, applying trigonometric functions to calculate positions and angles to build gradient path, labels position and the move logic of the gauge indicator. With this approach I will try to show the bridge between abstract mathematics and practical coding in Swift for iOS.
